        A <b>flower</b>, also known as a <b>bloom</b> or <b>blossom</b>,[1] is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division Angiospermae). Flowers consist of a combination of vegetative organs – sepals that enclose and protect the developing flower. Petals attract pollinators, and reproductive organs that produce gametophytes, which in flowering plants produce gametes. The male gametophytes, which produce sperm, are enclosed within pollen grains produced in the anthers. The female gametophytes are contained within the ovules produced in the ovary.[2][3] In some plants, multiple flowers occur singly on a pedicel (flower stalk), and some are arranged in a group (inflorescence) on a peduncle (inflorescence stalk).[2]
        <br>Most flowering plants depend on animals, such as bees, moths, and butterflies, to transfer their pollen between different flowers, and have evolved to attract these pollinators by various strategies, including brightly colored, large petals with patterns only visible to under ultraviolet light, attractive scents, and the production of nectar, a food source for pollinators.[4][2] In this way, many flowering plants have co-evolved with pollinators to be mutually dependent on services they provide to one another—in the plant's case, a means of reproduction; in the pollinator's case, a source of food.[5]
        <br>When pollen from the anther of a flower is transferred to the stigma to another, it is called pollination. Some flowers may self-pollinate, producing seed using pollen from a different flower of the same plant, but others have mechanisms to prevent self-pollination and rely on cross-pollination, when pollen is transferred from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species. Self-pollination happens in flowers where the stamen and carpel mature at the same time, and are positioned so that the pollen can land on the flower's stigma. This pollination does not require an investment from the plant to provide nectar and pollen as food for pollinators.[6] Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy).[7] After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds.[2]
        <br>Flowers have long been appreciated for their beauty and pleasant scents, and also hold cultural significance as religious, ritual, or symbolic objects, or sources of medicine and food.
        <br><br><b>Etymology</b><hr>
        Flower is from the Middle English <i>flour</i>, which referred to both the ground grain and the reproductive structure in plants, before splitting off in the 17th century. It comes originally from the Latin name of the Italian goddess of flowers, Flora. The early word for flower in English was <i>blossom</i>,[8] though it now refers to flowers only of fruit trees.[9]
        <br><br><b>Morphology</b><hr>
        <pre><i>Main article: Floral morphology</i></pre>
        The morphology of a flower, or its form and structure,[10] can be considered in two parts: the vegetative part, consisting of non-reproductive structures such as petals; and the reproductive or sexual parts. A stereotypical flower is made up of four kinds of structures arranged in whorls around the tip of a short stalk or axis, called a receptacle.[11][2] The four main whorls (starting from the base of the flower or lowest node and working upwards) are the calyx, corolla, androecium, and gynoecium. Together the calyx and corolla make up the non-reproductive part of the flower called the perianth, and in monocotyledons, may not be differentiated. If this is the case, then they are described as tepals.[2][12]
        <br><br><b>Perianth</b>
        <pre>  <i>Main article: Perianth</i></pre>
        <br><b>Calyx</b>
        <br><br>The sepals, collectively called the calyx, are modified leaves that occur on the outermost whorl of the flower.[2] They are leaf-like, in that they have a broad base, stomata and chlorophyll and may have stipules. Sepals are often waxy and tough, and grow quickly to protect the flower as it develops.[13][14] They may be deciduous, but will more commonly grow on to assist in fruit dispersal. If the calyx is fused it is called gamosepalous.[13] <br>
        <br><b>Corolla</b>
        <br><br>The petals, collectively called corolla, are almost or completely fiberless leaf-like structures that form the innermost whorl of the perianth. They are often delicate and thin and are usually colored, shaped, or scented to encourage pollination.[2][15] Although similar to leaves in shape, they are more comparable to stamens in that they form almost simultaneously with one another, but their subsequent growth is delayed. If the corolla is fused together it is called sympetalous.[16] In monocotyledonous flowers (e.g., Lilium sp.), petals and sepals are indistinguishable and are individually called tepals. Petals also tend to have patterns only visible under ultraviolet light, which are visible to pollinators but not to humans.[2]
        <br><br><b>Reproductive</b>
        <pre>  <i>Main article: Plant reproductive morphologyh</i></pre>
        <br><b>Androecium</b>
        <br><br>The androecium, consisting of stamens, is the whorl of pollen-producing male parts. Stamens consist typically of an anther, made up of four pollen sacs arranged in two thecae, connected to a filament, or stalk.[2] The anther contains microsporocytes which become pollen, the male gametophyte, after undergoing meiosis. Although they exhibit the widest variation among floral organs, the androecium is usually confined just to one whorl and to two whorls only in rare cases. Stamens range in number, size, shape, orientation, and in their point of connection to the flower.[15][16]
        <br><br>In general, there is only one type of stamen, but there are plant species where the flowers have two types; a "normal" one and one with anthers that produce sterile pollen meant to attract pollinators.[17]
        <br><br><b>Gynoecium</b>
        <br><br>The gynoecium, consisting of one or more carpels, is the female part of the flower found on the innermost whorl. Each carpel consists of a stigma, which receives pollen, a style, which acts as a stalk, and an ovary, which contains the ovules.[2] Carpels may occur in one to several whorls, and when fused are often described as a pistil. Inside the ovary, the ovules are attached to the placenta by structures called <i>funiculi</i>.[18][19]
        <br><br><b>Variation</b>
        <br><br>Although this arrangement is considered "typical", plant species show a wide variation in floral structure.[20] The four main parts of a flower are generally defined by their positions on the receptacle and not by their function. Many flowers lack some parts or parts may be modified into other functions or look like what is typically another part.[21] In some families, such as the grasses, the petals are greatly reduced; in many species, the sepals are colorful and petal-like. Other flowers have modified petal-like stamens; the double flowers of peonies and roses are mostly petaloid stamens.[22]
        <br><br>Many flowers have symmetry. When the perianth is bisected through the central axis from any point and symmetrical halves are produced, the flower is said to be actinomorphic or regular. This is an example of radial symmetry. When flowers are bisected and produce only one line that produces symmetrical halves, the flower is said to be irregular or zygomorphic. If, in rare cases, they have no symmetry at all they are called asymmetric.[23][24]
        <br><br>Flowers may be directly attached to the plant at their base (sessile—the supporting stalk or stem is highly reduced or absent). [2][25] The stem or stalk subtending a flower, or an inflorescence of flowers, is called a peduncle. If a peduncle supports more than one flower, the stems connecting each flower to the main axis are called pedicels. [2][26] The apex of a flowering stem forms a terminal swelling which is called the torus or receptacle.[2][24]
        <br><br>In the majority of species, individual flowers have both carpels and stamens. These flowers are described by botanists as being perfect, bisexual, or hermaphrodite. In some species of plants, the flowers are imperfect or unisexual: having only either male (stamen) or female (carpel) parts. If unisexual male and female flowers appear on the same plant, the species is called monoecious.[27] However, if an individual plant is either female or male, the species is called dioecious. Many flowers have floral nectaries, which are glands that produce a sugary fluid (nectar) used to attract pollinators. They are not considered as an organ on their own.[28]
        <br><br><b>Inflorescence</b>
        <pre>  <i>Main article: Inflorescence</i></pre>
        In those species that have more than one flower on an axis, the collective cluster of flowers is called an inflorescence. Some inflorescences are composed of many small flowers arranged in a formation that resembles a single flower. A common example of this is most members of the very large composite (Asteraceae) group. A single daisy or sunflower, for example, is not a flower but a flower head—an inflorescence composed of numerous flowers (or florets). [2][30] An inflorescence may include specialized stems and modified leaves known as bracts. [2][31]
        <br><br><b>Floral diagrams and formulae</b>
        <pre>   <i>Main articles: Floral formula and Floral diagram</i></pre>
        A floral formula is a way to represent the structure of a flower using specific letters, numbers, and symbols, presenting substantial information about the flower in a compact form. It can represent a taxon, usually giving ranges of the numbers of different organs, or particular species. Floral formulae have been developed in the early 19th century and their use has declined since. Prenner et al. (2010) devised an extension of the existing model to broaden the descriptive capability of the formula.[32] The format of floral formulae differs in different parts of the world, yet they convey the same information.[33][34][35][36]
        <br><br>The structure of a flower can also be expressed by the means of floral diagrams. The use of schematic diagrams can replace long descriptions or complicated drawings as a tool for understanding both floral structure and evolution. Such diagrams may show important features of flowers, including the relative positions of the various organs, including the presence of fusion and symmetry, as well as structural details.[37]
        <br><br><b>Development</b><hr>
        A flower develops on a modified shoot or axis from a determinate apical meristem (determinate meaning the axis grows to a set size). It has compressed internodes, bearing structures that in classical plant morphology are interpreted as highly modified leaves.[38] Detailed developmental studies, however, have shown that stamens are often initiated more or less like modified stems (caulomes) that in some cases may even resemble branchlets.[39][20] Taking into account the whole diversity in the development of the androecium of flowering plants, we find a continuum between modified leaves (phyllomes), modified stems (caulomes), and modified branchlets (shoots).[40][41]
        <br><br><b>Transition</b>
        <br><br>The transition to flowering is one of the major phase changes that a plant makes during its life cycle. The transition must take place at a time that is favorable for fertilization and the formation of seeds, hence ensuring maximal reproductive success. To meet these needs a plant can interpret important endogenous and environmental cues such as changes in levels of plant hormones and seasonable temperature and photoperiod changes.[42] Many perennial and most biennial plants require vernalization to flower. The molecular interpretation of these signals is through the transmission of a complex signal known as florigen, which involves a variety of genes, including Constans, Flowering Locus C, and Flowering Locus T. Florigen is produced in the leaves in reproductively favorable conditions and acts in buds and growing tips to induce several different physiological and morphological changes.[43]
        <br><br>The first step of the transition is the transformation of the vegetative stem primordia into floral primordia. This occurs as biochemical changes take place to change the cellular differentiation of leaf, bud and stem tissues into tissue that will grow into the reproductive organs. Growth of the central part of the stem tip stops or flattens out and the sides develop protuberances in a whorled or spiral fashion around the outside of the stem end. These protuberances develop into the sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels. Once this process begins, in most plants, it cannot be reversed and the stems develop flowers, even if the initial start of the flower formation event was dependent on some environmental cue.[44]
        <br><br><b>Organ development</b>
        <pre>   <i>Main article: ABC model of flower development</i></pre>
        The ABC model is a simple model that describes the genes responsible for the development of flowers. Three gene activities interact in a combinatorial manner to determine the developmental identities of the primordia organ within the floral apical meristem. These gene functions are called A, B, and C. Genes are expressed in only the outer and lower most section of the apical meristem, which becomes a whorl of sepals. In the second whorl, both A and B genes are expressed, leading to the formation of petals. In the third whorl, B and C genes interact to form stamens and in the center of the flower C genes alone give rise to carpels. The model is based upon studies of aberrant flowers and mutations in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and the snapdragon, <i> Antirrhinum majus</i>. For example, when there is a loss of B gene function, mutant flowers are produced with sepals in the first whorl as usual, but also in the second whorl instead of the normal petal formation. In the third whorl, the lack of the B function but the presence of the C function mimics the fourth whorl, leading to the formation of carpels also in the third whorl.[45]
        <br><br><b>Function</b><hr>
        <pre>  <i>See also: Plant reproductive morphology</i></pre>
        The principal purpose of a flower is the reproduction[46] of the individual and the species. All flowering plants are <i>heterosporous</i>, that is, every individual plant produces two types of spores. Microspores are produced by meiosis inside anthers and megaspores are produced inside ovules that are within an ovary. Anthers typically consist of four microsporangia and an ovule is an integumented megasporangium. Both types of spores develop into gametophytes inside sporangia. As with all heterosporous plants, the gametophytes also develop inside the spores, i.e., they are endosporic.
        <br><br><b>Pollination</b><hr>
        <pre>  <i>Main article: Pollination</i></pre>
        Since the flowers are the reproductive organs of the plant, they mediate the joining of the sperm, contained within pollen, to the ovules — contained in the ovary.[14] Pollination is the movement of pollen from the anthers to the stigma.[47] Normally pollen is moved from one plant to another, known as cross-pollination, but many plants can self-pollinate. Cross-pollination is preferred because it allows for genetic variation, which contributes to the survival of the species.[48] Many flowers depend on external factors for pollination, such as the wind, water, animals, and especially insects. Larger animals such as birds, bats, and even some pygmy possums,[49] however, can also be employed.[50][51] To accomplish this, flowers have specific designs which encourage the transfer of pollen from one plant to another of the same species. The period during which this process can take place (when the flower is fully expanded and functional) is called <i>anthesis</i>,[52] hence the study of pollination biology is called <i>anthecology</i>.[53]
        <br><br>Flowering plants usually face evolutionary pressure to optimize the transfer of their pollen, and this is typically reflected in the morphology of the flowers and the behavior of the plants.[54] Pollen may be transferred between plants via several 'vectors,' or methods. Around 80% of flowering plants make use of biotic or living vectors. Others use abiotic, or non-living, vectors and some plants make use of multiple vectors, but most are highly specialized.[55]
        <br><br>Though some fit between or outside of these groups,[56] most flowers can be divided between the following two broad groups of pollination methods:
        <br><br><b>Biotic pollination</b>
        <br><br>Flowers that use biotic vectors attract and use insects, bats, birds, or other animals to transfer pollen from one flower to the next. Often they are specialized in shape and have an arrangement of the stamens that ensures that pollen grains are transferred to the bodies of the pollinator when it lands in search of its attractant (such as nectar, pollen, or a mate).[57] In pursuing this attractant from many flowers of the same species, the pollinator transfers pollen to the stigmas—arranged with equally pointed precision—of all of the flowers it visits.[58] Many flowers rely on simple proximity between flower parts to ensure pollination, while others have elaborate designs to ensure pollination and prevent self-pollination.[48] Flowers use animals including: insects <i>(entomophily)</i>, birds <i>(ornithophily)</i>, bats <i>(chiropterophily)</i>, lizards,[51] and even snails and slugs <i>(malacophilae)</i>.[59]
        <br><br><b>Attraction methods</b>
        <br><br>Plants cannot move from one location to another, thus many flowers have evolved to attract animals to transfer pollen between individuals in dispersed populations. Most commonly, flowers are insect-pollinated, known as <i>entomophilous</i>; literally &quot;insect-loving&quot; in Greek.[61] To attract these insects flowers commonly have glands called nectaries on various parts that attract animals looking for nutritious nectar.[62] Some flowers have glands called elaiophores, which produce oils rather than nectar.[63] Birds and bees have color vision, enabling them to seek out colorful flowers.[64] Some flowers have patterns, called nectar guides, that show pollinators where to look for nectar; they may be visible only under ultraviolet light, which is visible to bees and some other insects.[65]
